Import a dictionary


1. Prepare the file: file path-to-dictionary.json

Feel free to add any of the available dictionaries created for the training sessions:
R&D Phase: https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/RD_Phase.csv   
Information Classification: https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/information_classification.csv  
Regulatory Region: https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/Regulatory_Region.csv  


2. Customise the name of the dictionary

Important: Add an identifier to recognise the dictionary you are importing. If the name is the same, the file will be replaced


3. Prepare and run the script

odm-update-dictionary -H ttps://q001-demo.trial.genestack.com --file_with_dictionaries path_to_dictionary.json --token [YourToken]
