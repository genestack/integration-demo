Import a dictionary


1. Prepare the Dictionary file

Use a JSON file structured like path-to-dictionary.json.
You may choose any of the dictionaries prepared for this training session:

R&D Phase
https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/RD_Phase.csv

Information Classification
https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/information_classification.csv

Regulatory Region
https://bio-test-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Training-Session-SRL/Dictionaries/Regulatory_Region.csv 


2. Customise the name of the dictionary

Add a unique identifier to the dictionary name so it can be clearly recognised later.

Important:
If you reuse an existing dictionary name, the old dictionary will be replaced.


3. Prepare and run the script
Dictionary imports must be performed using a root-level token, as only dictionaries imported with elevated permissions can be recognised via SDKs and used in template import scripts.

Run:
odm-update-dictionary -H https://q001-demo.trial.genestack.com --file_with_dictionaries path_to_dictionary.json --token [PublicToken]

Note: For security reasons, the public token is not displayed here, instead, will be shared during the training session
